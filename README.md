This is my DALI developer challenge!

The code is broken up into pages which contain specialized components for the interface to a social media platform, BookFace!  

There are 3 pages: a discovery page in which every post, your list of friends, and all other users appear on the screen, 
a posts page to display a specific user's posts, and a profile page. The application applies useContext as a dummy authentication (for now, I am logged in!)
and thus could be tailored to each individual user. The option to create a new post opens a modal with a custom form, though without a backend, the data is temporarily
logged in the console.  Clicking on a friend will show their posts, while clicking on a new person in the discovery panel will bring you to their profile. The username
is created through a function called nameChanger which is used to create the customized UI (Jack Macy becomes the username jackmacy). The Navigation also works the same,
so feel free to type in the name of an individual in the system in the format of the nameChanger to view their profile.

This represents my first time using bootstrap and APIs!

It utilizes React, React-Bootstrap, and a custom Form hook for all of its processes.
